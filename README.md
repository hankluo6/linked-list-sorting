# linked-list-sorting

In this project, we focus on 3 different aspects of linked list sort

- We provide 4 different sorting algorithms:
  - intro sort
  - tree sort
  - quick sort with recursion
  - quick sort without recursion

- We used experiments to validate the result of the paper [Introspective Sorting and Selection Algorithms](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.14.5196&rep=rep1&type=pdf).

- Compare tree sort and [linux/lib/list_sort.c](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/lib/list_sort.c), finding the cause of performance difference.

You can find the detailed report in [hackmd](https://hackmd.io/@hankluo6/linked-list-sort).
